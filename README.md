# Squirrel Spotter
GitHub Repository for our Squirrel Spotter (Knight Hacks 2024 Hackathon). Although the webpage is currently a work-in-progress, our goal is to create a website that allows users to input the locations of squirrels found on campus.<br><br>
To demo our project, download the repository and open **index.html** on **localhost**.<br><br>
A huge thank you to the Knight Hacks organizers for an amazing time!
